        <h1>ABOUT ORIGAMI</h1>
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Origami first appeared in 6th century Japan, and was originally practised by Buddhist monks.</p>
        <p>This art was exclusively reserved for religion (representation of the gods) and ceremonies (death or marriage). It is now practised for pleasure!</p> 

        <br> 
        <h1>ON PAPER</h1>
        <h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2>
        <p>A sheet of paper can only be folded seven times on itself...</p>
        <p>And if you could fold it forty-two times on itself, that would be equivalent to the distance from the Earth to the Sun!</p>
        <p>Paper first appeared in China and then Japan, but it was Islam that really spread this medium (initially to spread the Koran).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>FAMILIES OF PAPER</h2>

        <ul >
            <li >Printing, writing and communication (paper for newspapers and magazines)</li>
            <li >Office (xerography, laser, inkjet)</li>
            <li >Writing</li>
            <li >Packaging (corrugated or flexible kraft, coated on one side, etc.)</li>
            <li >Sanitary and domestic use (toilet paper, handkerchiefs, medical paper for sterilisation bags, wipes).</li>
            <li >Industrial and special papers (cigarette, decorative, tracing paper, crystal, greaseproof, coin, etc.).</li>
            <li >But also cardboard of all kinds or labels!</li>
        </ul>
