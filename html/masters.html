                <summary>Eric VIGIER, "The Mad Folder"</summary>
                <p>Eric Vigier (nicknamed "the crazy folder"), is a French autistic origamist, from Normandy more precisely.</p>
                <p>He has been passionate about origami for over 20 years.</p>
                    
                <p>He wrote about himself:</p>
                <p>"After many years of sculpting folds, from there emerging characters, animals or objects striking with truth and presence, today it is much more than a technique of plastic creation, it is a poetry, a philosophy , an asceticism…

                    Through the multiplication of folds appears the creation of space-hogging entities.
                    
                    From the intellect to the dream, from the will to the impulse, the forms of this art, of this poetics of space and matter are both timeless and sensually linked to great delicacy, their appearance relating to ritual and of obsession.
                    
                    First captivated by the magic of transforming a simple sheet through a few folding sequences, leaving no room for cutting or gluing, the first years gave birth to simple but recognizable shapes; for the record, the trigger being a film where a murderer made a simple bird; rest assured, despite some 4000 folds, I haven’t killed anyone yet…
                    
                    Then the intensity, the tenacity, the perfectionism, 2 to 4 hours every day throughout these years made me realize that this Know-how was intended for me through the symbiosis of domains characterizing me: Nature , the Enigmatic and the Art. Origami has become, in the extension of my fingers, the extension of my mind and my body.
                    
                    So I became the mad folder!”</p>

                <summary>Jo NAKASHIMA</summary>

                <p>The Brazilian creative Jo Nakashima, of Japanese origin, has always been passionate about this art technique which is based on a paper folding system. This young origami artist launched on YouTube in 2007 by reproducing origami before creating his own from 2010.</p>

                <p>Unlike classic origami which favors white paper, Jo Nakashima mainly uses colored sheets. In addition to traditional models, he is a master in the art of creating shape-changing compositions using modular cubes. Thus, he is quite capable of creating multiple animals such as an eagle, a duck or a turtle but also Rubik's Cubes.</p>
                    
                <p>For the most curious, he shares “simplified” tutorials and DIY tips on his YouTube channel to make them at home. We might as well tell you that you will surely have to be patient before reaching such a level of perfection.</p>

                <summary>Eric JOISEL</summary>

                <p>Eric Joisel (aka the Magician) is considered by his peers to have been among the finest origami masters in the world. This beloved French artist and sculptor created stunningly beautiful and complex sculpted origami paper models. Origami is the Japanese art of forming sculptures out of paper only. And Eric Joisel took this to a whole new level. His pieces are not regular origami models, but completely different interpretations of a very ancient art form.</p>

                <p>Most of Eric’s models are three dimensional and lifelike in appearance. Eric could spend more than 100-hours folding a single piece of paper in order to create his amazing pieces of art.</p>

                <p>“Origami is very difficult”, he said. “When people ask how long it takes me to make a sculpture I say ’35 years’, because that is how long it’s taken me to get to this level.”</p>

                <p>“I have worked in clay, stone and wood before working in paper. I prefer creating human figures more than animals. Before I was able to attempt folding a complete human figure, I practiced making masks and faces for many years. This was more than just production, it was the process of breathing life into the paper and most importantly, partially improvising with every model so that each one was distinctive. This is different than traditional origami where every step is exactly defined so that folders could produce accurate copies. All my models are completely unique.”</p>

                <p>Since 1984, Eric showcased his origami art in international exhibitions around the world from the Louvre to Japan and Seattle.</p>

                <summary>Sadako SASAKI</summary>
                <p>According to Japanese custom, folding 1,000 paper cranes (called Senbazuru) grants you a special wish. </p>

                <p>Although the idea seems attractive, creating the legend of the 1000 cranes is not an easy project and more than one has lost teeth. Some people even decide to group together to try to make a Senbazuru.</p>
                    
                <p>Sadako Sasaki popularized this practice, making it a national, even global, phenomenon.</p>
                    
                <p>This little girl from the Hiroshima region was only two years old when the atomic bomb was dropped by the Americans during the Second World War.</p>
                    
                <p>Poisoned, the little girl developed leukemia around the age of twelve.</p>
                    
                <p>Inspired by the legend of senbazuru, she began to fold cranes. We could then say to ourselves that his dearest wish was to regain health (which would still be quite legitimate!).</p>
                    
                <p>It was nothing of the sort...</p>
                    
                <p>Little Sadako Sasaki's wish, what she wanted from the bottom of her heart, was a return to peace for the whole world.</p>
                    
                <p>Planetary peace, that’s what she intended to ask for.</p>
                    
                <p>Despite her immense will, she does not succeed in fulfilling the legend of the 1000 cranes. Too weak to continue, Sadako Sasaki died on October 25, 1955, when she had only folded 644.</p>
                    
                <p>As his story touched the local community, his family and classmates decided to complete the senbazuru in his honor.</p>
                    
                <p>This touching story marked the hearts of many Japanese and it did not take long for the story of his life to tour the archipelago, then the entire world. Sadako Sasaki is often cited as a symbol of innocent children affected by war.</p>
                    
                <p>In 1958, a statue of Sadako holding a golden crane was erected in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.</p>

                <summary>On Paper</summary>
                <h1>The Basics of Modern Paper Folding</h1>
            <p> Origami is based on a few basic folding techniques, which are generally found at the beginning of all origami books. Basic diagrams (based on the Yoshizawa-Randlett representation system) generally show the following types of folds to start with: inside and outside (“valley”/“mountain”) folds, reverse folds, and counterfolds. There are then a certain number of "bases" such as the "crane base" or "frog base" or even "fish base", which allow you to create not only these animals, but also other figures from the same folds of departure.</p>
            
            <p> Traditionally, we fold from a square and without glue. These are the classic rules of origami - which already make it possible to carry out a large number of folds (figurative or not). Purists believe that no instrument should be used to make origami, but some, such as tweezers or paper clips, can sometimes be extremely useful.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2> Origami and origamist techniques</h2>
            <p> The art of origami is ancestral but its modern renaissance only dates from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the master of Japanese paper folding, Akira Yoshizawa. He is considered the one who democratized an art that was until now very traditional and essentially practiced for decorative and religious purposes. Since then, many origamists have contributed to developing this art all over the world.</p>
            
            <h2> The different types of origami</h2>
            <p> Classic origami generally represents animals, flowers, plants or inanimate objects such as boxes or balloons, easy to make figures that you learn to begin with. But there are also “origami actions”, which can be animated according to certain folding principles. We can animate animals of course (the jumping frog is a good example) but also origami “games” like cubes or rings that “make and break”.</p>
            <p> Modular origami in particular makes it possible to achieve this type of animated folding. Modular consists of assembling different parts to form a larger one. “3D” origami, which consists of assembling several small triangular modules into a final piece, is part of this technique.</p>
            
            <p> “Wet” folding is a technique that is closer to sculpture. The paper is lightly wetted so that it can form curves and create a model more faithful to nature - this is why it is often used to represent animals. When drying, the paper hardens and keeps the shape given to it. With this technique, we also use an adhesive (size) which keeps its shape once dry.</p>
            
            <p> There are then a certain number of geometric origami techniques, such as "tessellations" (whose models are like kaleidoscopic foldings), "Pureland" origami which only allows models to be made from interior folds and exteriors, and origami architecture, in which relief models are made, sometimes combined with cut-out paper. The latter is considered an artistic branch in its own right.</p>
            
            <h2>Some famous origamists in Japan and the United States</h2>
            <p>The best-known origami artist is of course Akira Yoshizawa, but many other artists worked with him, or at the same time, or inherited his know-how. The art of origami has also developed well beyond the borders of Japan and great origami artists work in particular in the United States, Germany and France, in South America and in other Asian countries.</p>
            <p>The origamist Samuel L. Randlett co-developed (with Robert Harbin) the Yoshizawa-Randlett system, so named because it is inherited from the representation system initially designed by Akira Yoshizawa. This system has since been adopted throughout the world. One of the pioneering origami artists in the United States is Florence Temko. She has notably written more than fifty books on the art of paper folding. The United States has many renowned artists such as Michael G. LaFosse, Peter Engel…</p>
            
            <p>Another famous American origami artist is Robert J. Lang, also an origami physicist and mathematician. He is one of the world's leading experts, recognized not only for his models but also for contributing to major scientific advances by applying techniques from origami mathematics to real-world engineering problems.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, Japan also has many origami artists, such as Humiaki Huzita, the originator of the first six principles of Huzita-Hatori which help define the framework of origami mathematics for the purpose of solving geometric construction problems . Many artists are also mathematicians or scientists and have helped to develop, in one way or another, the mathematical rules of paper folding. This is the case of Kunihiko Kasahara. Among Japanese artists, we also know Toshikazu Kawasaki (the “father of the origami rose”), Makoto Yamaguchi (President of Origami House and close to the major origami associations in the world) and Satoshi Kamiya, one of the most young origami geniuses.</p>
